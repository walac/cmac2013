Cellular Automata (CAs) are totally discrete systems which work locally on a
simple and deterministic way, but whose resulting overall behavior can be
extremelly complex. The set of all possible global configurations in a given
finite time step *t* for an CA can be described by a process graph, that
is a kind of finite automaton which all states are initial and final states.

We propose a new processes graph representation through matrices. This notation
allow us to derive process graph forming algorithms for any CA time step which
has structuring growth.

We conclude that this new notation makes easier process graphs forming
algorithms and accelarate the CAs computation experiments.
